# Autobill: A generic resource analyser for functional languages 

**Note: This is alpha-quality software. A beta version is planned for the new year.**

Autobill is an experimental programming language for resource analysis. It based
on call-by-push-value lambda-calculus, with a polymorphic type system (*Ã  la*
System F). The memory usage of Autobill programs can be automatically estimated
in three steps:
- Programs are automatically translated with explicit resource management;
- Explicit resources are typed to extract equations bounding their amounts;
- Those equations are solved using an off-the-shelf solver.
